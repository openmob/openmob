# Open Urban Mobility Toolkit (OpenMob)

This project contains several preprocessing tools built by python:
* Basic function to detect stay points given GPS trajectory datasets.
* Building life pattern tree from raw GPS trajectory data.
* Preprocessing tools are used for the generation model of the "pseudo life pattern." 
* Essential preprocessing tools for converting raw GPS data to grid-based data format.
* Pseudo life pattern to the spatial sequence of trips.
* Map-matching as post-processing of GPS trajectory.

## datasets
* NYC and Tokyo Check-in Dataset. For more details, please refer to [Foursquare Dataset](https://sites.google.com/site/yangdingqi/home/foursquare-dataset).
* open travel mode data. For more details, please refer to this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.08527.pdf).

## Usage
This project is built from Python=3.8.4.\
Please refer to the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for the necessary python library.
